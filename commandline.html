			Windows Command Line, you are a royal <strong>bitch</strong>.
		</p>
		<p> In so many ways, you've been good to me and have provided for me as a reliable and constant supporter in my life. But in a world of Macs, it can be hard to make things work with you. 
			</p>
		<p>I've been contemplating writing this breakup letter to your Windows family for awhile now, but seeing this side of you through terminal was the <strong>last straw</strong>.
		</p>
		<p>
			I mean, honestly. Sometimes it makes me feel like you want to be so different from all of the Macs out there, but this makes it hard for me to think, get work done, and appreciate the great aspects of our relationship.  
		</p>
		<p>
			I know you're going to want to read the facts, so here we go:
			<ul>
				<li>You're incredibly difficult to navigate and control. With a mac, I could type <span class="keyword">ls or ls -a</span> to show directories and even hidden ones, but you're so closed off and unwilling to show me new sides of you, so I can only type <span class="keyword">dir</span> to see the visible directories. 
				</li>
				<li>
					I also have a hard time figuring out what you think of me, and where we are together. With macs I've seen in the past, they let me type <span class="keyword">pwd</span> to see exactly where I am. But with you, God only knows (literally, who knows?)
				</li>
				<li>Nothing is easy with you. On a mac, I could make many directories at once, but with you I have to type <span class="keyword">mkdir</span> for each new directory. I can't even see what directory I'm in. You just don't seem to care about making things easy on me. </li>
				<li>With macs, its only takes a TOUCH of a button to create a file; simple as that. When I ask you to make a new file, I have to type so much more <span class="keyword">(echo > filename)</span>. How can so much be lost in translation?</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
		 <p>
			But, I will give credit where credit is due. Changing directories with you is just as easy as any other. All I have to type is cd followed by the name of the directory and it really is as simple as that. Sometimes you do bend over backwards for me, letting me jump between levels by typing <span class="keyword">../</span>
		</p>
		<p>
			Finally, you compete just the same as macs when it comes to connecting to the server and uploading my files to creative.colorado.edu. Depending on if I'm <span class="keyword">remote</span> or not, I have two options. If I'm remote, I open two of your tabs and type <span class="keyword">ssh sofo1413@creative.colorado.edu</span>, then my <span class="keyword">password</span>, and <span class="keyword">cd into public_html</span>. Then I <span class="keyword">cd or make a directory</span> and my file is up!
		</p>
		<p>
			If I'm <span class="keyword">local</span>, I just <span class="keyword">cd into the directory I want</span>, type <span class="keyword">scp followed by the page I want to upload</span>, followed by  <span class="keyword">sofo1413@colorado.edu:public_html/the directory</span> and then finally I type in my <span class="keyword">password</span>.
		</p>
		<p>
			Overall, you get the job done-- don't get me wrong there. But love is about so much more than checking the boxes. It's about ease; making cute things like banners or an entire Star Wars movie. And when it comes to the little things, you just don't cut it. My wish is not you COMMAND, and that's and issue.

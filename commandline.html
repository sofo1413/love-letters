			Windows Command Line, you are a royal <strong>bitch</strong>.
		</p>
		<p> In so many ways, you've been good to me and have provided for me as a reliable and constant supporter in my life. But in a world of Macs, it can be hard to make things work with you. 
			</p>
		<p>I've been contemplating writing this breakup letter to your Windows family for awhile now, but seeing this side of you through terminal was the <strong>last straw</strong>.
		</p>
		<p>
			I mean, honestly. Sometimes it makes me feel like you want to be so different from all of the Macs out there, but this makes it hard for me to think, get work done, and appreciate the great aspects of our relationship.  
		</p>
		<p>
			I know you're going to want to read the facts, so here we go:
			<ul>
				<li>You're incredibly difficult to navigate and control. With a mac, I could type ls or ls -a to show directories and even hidden ones, but you're so closed off and unwilling to show me new sides of you and I can only type dir. </li>
				<li>Nothing is easy with you. On a mac, I could make many directories at once, but with you I have to type mkdir for each new directory. I can't even see what directory I'm in. You just don't seem to care about making things easy on me. </li>
				<li>With macs, its only takes a TOUCH of a button to create a file; simple as that. When I ask you to make a new file, I have to type so much more (echo > filename). How can so much be lost in translation?</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
		 <p>
			But, I will give credit where credit is due. Changing directories with you is just as easy as any other. All I have to type is cd followed by the name of the directory and it really is as simple as that. Sometimes you do bend over backwards for me, letting me jump between levels by typing ../
		</p>
		<p>
			Overall, you get the job done-- don't get me wrong there. But love is about so much more than checking the boxes. It's about ease; making cute things like banners or an entire Star Wars movie. And when it comes to the little things, you just don't cut it. My wish is not you COMMAND, and that's and issue.

			<h1>GitHub Love Letter</h1>
		</header>
		<p>
			GitHub, you make life <strong>SO</strong> easy.  What did I do to deserve you?  I don't GIT it.  From the way you let me make one repository after another, to how you're always looking for my new changes.  Even though I'm the one pushing them, you PUSH me.
		</p>
		<p>
			I want you to know just how much you mean to me, so I'm going to tell you all of my favorite things about you.
		</p>
		<p>
			Let's start from the beginning.  Once you were on my radar, I couldn't GIT enough.  I logged in, and hit that cute little button of yours in the top right corner. It's shaped like a plus, because I needed to ADD you into my life.
		</p>
		<p>
			From there you gave me all the options; really rolled out the red carpet for me.  Of all the options you provided in that dropdown menu, the way you let me make new repositories really spoke to me.
			</p>
		<p>
			Each repository I make with you is a new memory to cherish, so I name each one of them just to remember how unique our time is together. Although you don't make me do this, sometimes I'll add a description so that everyone can read about how special you are, and the incredible things we do together.
			</p>
		<p>
			I always make our repositories PUBLIC, because who wouldn't want the entire world to know about us? We really are <strong> THE BEST</strong> together.  By making them public, anyone can search for our relationship and see what we've done together over the years. Heck,  recruiters might even offer us jobs after seeing what we are capable of together.
			</p>
		<p>
			Then I click that create button and we are well on our way to our next adventure- I always learn so much with you. 
			</p>
		<p>
			The next page is one of my favorites because this is when our relationship really becomes official. I follow the directions to push an existing repository from the command line so that we can truly have the world at our fingertips. 
			</p>
		<p>
			In the command line, I type "git remote add origin url" so that the command line can finally communicate with you. Then, when all is said and done, I type "git push -u origin master" to PUSH our relationship to its full potential. 
			</p>
		<p>
			The last thing I do is icing on the cake. If I want people to be able to better understand what we've done together, I write a readme and push the changes and the world can read all about it.

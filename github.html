			GitHub, you make life <strong>SO</strong> easy.  What did I do to deserve you?  I don't <span class="keyword">GIT</span> it.  From the way you let me make one repository after another, to how you're always looking for my new changes.  Even though I'm the one pushing them, you PUSH me.
		</p>
		<p>
			I want you to know just how much you mean to me, so I'm going to tell you all of my favorite things about you.
		</p>
		<h2>Things I LOVE About MY HUB(by)</h2>
		<h3>1) Gitting Started with YOU</h3>
		<p>
			Let's start from the beginning.  Once you were on my radar, I couldn't GIT enough. I heard all about you from friends; the way you store repositories and care for them, spread kindness by sharing projects and memories, and even working together. You just have SO many talents! 
		</p>
		<p>
			I started my story with you by going to your website, and creating a new account with my email. I made a username and password so that our relationship could blossom in privacy until I was ready to officially <span class="keyword">COMMIT</span>.
		<h3>2) Making new REPOSITORY MEMORIES!</h3>
		<p>
			Let's start from the beginning.  Once you were on my radar, I couldn't GIT enough.  I logged in, and hit that cute little button of yours in the top right corner. It's shaped like a plus, because I needed to <span class="keyword">ADD</span> you into my life.
		</p>
		<p>
			From there you gave me all the options; really rolled out the red carpet for me.  Of all the options you provided in that dropdown menu, the way you let me make new repositories really spoke to me.
			</p>
		<p>
			Each repository I make with you is a new memory to cherish, so I name each one of them just to remember how unique our time is together. Although you don't make me do this, sometimes I'll add a description so that everyone can read about how special you are, and the incredible things we do together.
			</p>
			<h3>3) Making our MEMORIES PUBLIC</h3>
		<p>
			I always make our repositories <span class="keyword">PUBLIC</span>, because who wouldn't want the entire world to know about us? We really are <strong> THE BEST</strong> together.  By making them public, anyone can search for our relationship and see what we've done together over the years. Heck,  recruiters might even offer us jobs after seeing what we are capable of together.
			</p>
			<p>
				I also make sure the <span class="keyword">README</span> box is unchecked for now (that makes up our special memories that I like making myself).
			</p>
		<p>
			Then I click that create button and we are well on our way to our next adventure- I always learn so much with you. 
			</p>
			<h3>4) Pushing our LIMITS to the COMMAND LINE and BEYOND</h3>
		<p>
			The next page is one of my favorites because this is when our relationship really becomes official. I follow the directions to push an existing repository from the command line so that we can truly have the world at our fingertips. 
			</p>
		<p>
			In the command line, I type <span class="keyword">"git remote add origin"</span> followed by our URL so that the command line can finally communicate with you. Then, when all is said and done, I type <span class="keyword">"git push -u origin master"</span> to PUSH our relationship to its full potential. 
		</p>
		<p>
			Once our love is in full swing, I <span class="keyword">check my commits</span> on your website to see the new things we've done together, and make sure our memories in terminal have made it to the public eye.  See my love letter to <a href="git.html" target="_blank">GIT</a> and my frustrations with <a href="commandline.html" target="_blank">Windows Terminal</a> for the logistics of how I show you love, sweet GitHub.	</p>
		<h3>5) Reading you, reading me via README</h3>
		<p>
			The last thing I do is icing on the cake, but really makes the difference. If I want people to be able to better understand what we've done together, I write a <span class="keyword">README</span> and push the changes so the world can read all about it.

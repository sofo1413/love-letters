			<h1>GIT Love letter</h1>
		</header>
		<p>
			Oh git, where do I start?  You've really got me wrapped around your little finger.  From the way you PUSH me to be a better person, to your clear and true COMMITment to our relationship, it's a no brainer that you're the one for me.  How did I GIT so lucky?
		</p>
		<p>
			You've always been honest from the very beginning. Whenever I initialize a repository, I know I can count on you and have confidence that you will listen to me. You create a hidden folder to hold all of the sweet memories our future has in store.
		</p>
		<p>
			I never feel shaky with you- our relationship is rock solid and I have full confidence that it is because we are in constant communication.
		</p>
		<p>
			I'm never left wondering; if I ever what to know what's going on with you or if anything has changed between the two of us, I can ask the status and you tell me right away.
		</p>
		<p>
			From there, I can add all the changes so that we're back on the same page. One of my <strong>FAVORITE</strong> things about you is that if more than one thing has changed, I can add all of them at once, no questions asked, PERIOD. 
		</p>
		<p>
			Finally, when I'm ready for the world to see our changes, we are ready to commit and make a permanent record of our love. You are always detail oriented and ask for a message, just so we can always remember what changes have been made. After all, life is about the journey-- not the destination.
		</p>
		<p>
			You know me so well, sometimes even better than I know myself. You know my strengths, but you also know my weaknesses (one of them being my indecisive side), so this next one has got to be one of the greatest aspects of our relationships. 
		</p>
		<p>
			If I feel like something we are doing together could go a number of different directions, or that something may or may not work but is worth the shot, you let me take those risks. You give me opportunities to BRANCH out and try new things without consequences! You copy a version of the file and I name it something special so that I can change all I want without the risk of losing our current memories. I can make as many branches as I want until I've found one that serves us justice.
		</p>
		<p>
			With my different branches, you allow me to go back and forth between versions by checking out which version I want to edit. It's so sweet of you to let me bounce back and forth-- <strong>FREEDOM IS SWEET</strong>.

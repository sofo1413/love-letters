			Oh git, where do I start?  You've really got me wrapped around your little finger.  From the way you PUSH me to be a better person, to your clear and true COMMITment to our relationship, it's a no brainer that you're the one for me.  How did I GIT so lucky?
		</p>
		<p>
			 <strong><span class="topic" id="init">INIT to WIN IT: </span></strong> You've always been honest from the very beginning. Whenever I initialize a repository by typing <span class="keyword">git init</span> followed by the name of the repo, I know I can count on you and have confidence that you will listen to me. You <span class="keyword">create a hidden folder</span> to hold all of the sweet memories our future has in store.
			I never feel shaky with you- our relationship is rock solid and I have full confidence that it is because we are in constant communication.
		</p>
		<p>
			<strong><span class="topic" id="status">Relationship STATUS: </span></strong>I'm never left wondering; if I ever what to know what's going on with you or if anything has changed between the two of us, I can ask the status by typing <span class="keyword">git status</span> and you tell me right away.
		</p>
		<p>
			<strong><span class="topic" id="add">ADD-ly in Love: </span></strong>From there, I can add all the changes so that we're back on the same page by typing <span class="keyword">git add .</span>! One of my <strong>FAVORITE</strong> things about you is that if more than one thing has changed, I can add all of them at once, no questions asked, PERIOD. 
		</p>
		<p>
			<strong><span class="topic" id="commit">COMMITment is Key: </span></strong>Finally, when I'm ready for the world to see our changes, we are ready to commit and make a permanent record of our love by typing <span class="keyword">git commit -m</span> followed by a message. You are always detail oriented and ask for a message, just so we can always remember what changes have been made. After all, life is about the journey-- not the destination.
		</p>
		<p>
			You know me so well, sometimes even better than I know myself. You know my strengths, but you also know my weaknesses (one of them being my indecisive side), so this next one has got to be one of the greatest aspects of our relationships. 
		</p>
		<p>
			<strong><span class="topic" id="branch">Growing & Blossoming through BRANCHES: </span></strong>If I feel like something we are doing together could go a number of different directions, or that something may or may not work but is worth the shot, you let me take those risks. You give me opportunities to BRANCH out and try new things without consequences by typing <span class="keyword">git branch</span> followed by a name for the branch! You copy a version of the file and I name it something special so that I can change all I want without the risk of losing our current memories. I can make as many branches as I want until I've found one that serves us justice.
		</p>
		<p>
			<strong><span class="topic" id="checkout">Love CHECKin' you OUT: </span></strong>With my different branches, you allow me to go back and forth between versions by checking out which version I want to edit, and typing <span class="keyword">git checkout</span> followed by the name of the branch. It's so sweet of you to let me bounce back and forth-- <strong>FREEDOM IS SWEET</strong>.
			</p> 
			<p>
				<strong><span class="topic" id="merge">MERGIN' on the Love Highway: </span></strong>Once I'm satisfied with the one of the branches and want that one to be the <strong>real</strong> deal, you help me merge the two so I don't get confused, so thoughtful of you. All I have to do is type <span class="keyword">git merge</span> followed by the name of the branch that I liked best and you make the magic happen from there!
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong><span class="topic" id="delete">The sweet DELETE: </span></strong>Finally, when all is said and done, you help me clean up my messes. If I ever have branches that I don't want anymore, you help me delete them by typing <span class="keyword">git branch -D</span> followed by the name of the branch to delete.
		</p>
		<p>
			<strong><span class="topic" id="log">Log of My Life: </span></strong>Oh gosh, can't forget one last great thing about you! This one is kind of like the scrapbook of our love. I can see any of our commitments over time by typing <span class="keyword">git log</span> to see every commitment made, the time and date, and the file that was changed or committed. I wouldn't want to track our history any other way.
